  <header class="aboutme">
      <h3>I'm Roberto. I'm a web developer based in Denver. I grew up in the Pacific, and I've always been more drawn to Asia than Europe. I've lived in Hawaii, Saipan and Japan, where I spent most of my free time surfing, hiking, playing music, and immersing myself in language and culture. I'm passionate about the arts and cultural identity, and I'm excited about any project that allows me to integrate my skills into a diverse, progressive, and socially stimulating environment. We are powerful people, and I believe in the power of one.</h3>
