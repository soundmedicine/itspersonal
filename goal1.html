    <h1>setting goals, January 2, 2018</h1>
    <p>Today, I've set two goals for myself: re-do the JavaScript code for three project submissions that were returned, and take another look at using Firebase as a host for files and website deployment. My JavaScript submissions were returned because my
      code was relatively sloppy and inconsistent. I'd been having trouble deploying my website on Firebase, in spite of having successfully used it before, so I'd like to retrace my steps and make sure I'm not missing anything. My goal isn't to deploy
      my website today, but to gain a better understanding of which step(s) I may be missing and their significance in the process. With the JavaScript submissions, my goal is to gain better understanding of the proper syntax, and resubmit all three projects
      after having cleaned up my code.</p>

    <h2>reflecting</h2>
    <p>I started on the JavaScript submissions, because the fact that my code was working but criticized for being sloppy was eating away at my obsessive mind. I applied the advice of my mentor and made sure my code was consistent (namely in my use -- or
      misuse -- of semicolons). Then I realized I hadn't been utilizing my text-editor's "beautify" package, which, once I applied, took care of the inconsistent and questionable indentations. It didn't take me long to resubmit all three projects, and
      I immediately received the reaffirming feedback I needed to calm my frustration, and was able to move on to Firebase. I started from the very beginning, watching a video of the demonstration I attended when I was first learning about deployment
      and static host services, and re-did every step. When I came to it, I immediately realized I had been coding the .json file incorrectly. Once I had corrected the code to make my directory public, I was able to deploy the site immediately. I had
      tried so many different commands in my terminal before, which took so much more time than it had to just re-watch the demonstration and re-trace every step. I've had less successful days problem-solving, so the ease with which I'd acheived my two
      goals today was refreshing.</p>
