    <h1>setting goals, January 4, 2018</h1>
    <p>My goals today are to update content on my website, play with some JavaScript code, and take a look at my next project submission. My site right now looks pretty plain, and although I'd like to keep it simple and easily-navigable, I'd like to add
      a little more visual content to make it more interesting, and play around with positioning my textual content with some CSS values. I've been a bit intimidated by JavaScript, so it's about time to get my hands dirtier and get some practice in with
      some CodeWars challenges. And as I get more comfortable with JavaScript and more satisfied with my website (for now), I'd like to continue moving forward with future project submissions.</p>

    <h2>reflecting</h2>
    <p>I was able to play with adding content to and manipulate positioning with elements on my website. This gave me a clearer conceptualization of my theme, and I found some images I decided to incorporate. I also spent some time browsing submission requirements
      for future projects, and I was able to commit to some reading and exercises to start. CodeWars was a bust, because I'd run out of time, but I'm satisfied that I'd put more time into my other two goals.</p>
