    <h1>setting goals, January 5, 2017</h1>
    <p>Having decided on where to start my next project submissions, I will be reading through material, and start at least one exercise about serving data to clients from a server. I will also be completing the text for my personal website, and adding more
      visual content to my page. I'd like to considerate it complete by tomorrow, so my work today will be setting this goal up for success.</p>

    <h2>reflecting</h2>
    <p>I was able to spend some valuable time reading up on the relationship between clients and servers and their respective processes, and followed directions on creating the very simple app from the reading. I delved into some deeper reading online, which
      I got pretty lost in. But I value the input, and will give it a chance to settle in my brain for now. The content for my website is almost to a place where I'd consider it complete enough for submission, so tomorrow will be for some final tweaks
      and details. Since what I've been able to do today has set me up for success tomorrow, I feel pretty satisfied about the work I put in, and am looking forward to executing some final changes to my website, as well as gaining some deeper understanding
      in my further studies tomorrow. I've also realized that my current understanding of JavaScript is hardly enough to comprehend all the material available on my subsequent project submissions, so I will be prioritizing more JavaScript research and
      practice this coming weekend and week.</p>
