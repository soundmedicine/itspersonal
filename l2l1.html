    <h2>setting the stage</h2>
    <p>Today I set out to learn more about floats in CSS. I'd been obsessing over flex-box, which has served me well, but its contribution is still limiting when it comes to design. In an effort to make my stylesheets more flexible and comprehensive, I wanted
      to expand my repertoire of values. Setting the stage begins at 5:30 am for me. If I'm worried about getting hungry, sleepy or restless, it's in my best interest to give myself enough time to set up the rest of my morning, if not my entire day. This
      morning I woke up to my alarm and gave myself a few minutes to decide which would benefit me more: another hour of sleep or another hour to take my time preparing. I knew I would feel much more energized if I allowed myself time for a nice workout
      after some coffee, time to enjoy eating a protein-packed breakfast after that, and time to visualize what my day would look like, and what projects I would focus on. By the time I've started editing text and committing changes, I've made sure any
      open windows on my workspace are related to the content of my project. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, I've acknowledged agreements with myself about my work-flow. I agree that I can be more productive when I don't skip steps to provide myself
      with a comfortable space to work in. I agree to allow myself to express my creativity through my work, rather than focus on whether I'm being productive or adhering to standards. I agree that these issues are things that I will have the opportunity
      to deal with later, because I am confident they will come up again if my work is unsatisfactory. And I especially agree that my work, whatever it yields, is valuable and not a matter of success or failure; it is productive because I have prepared
      myself to be productive. I trust myself. Giving myself ample time to prepare my physical body and workplace allows me to keep these agreements, without constantly negotiating them in the middle of my day. Creating these agreements with myself allows
      me to enjoy what I do. By the time I've sat down and opened up my laptop, my thoughts have already been focused on the task at hand: applying floats to my stylesheet. Rather than spending most of my time debating about what the most effective code
      will be, my agreements allow me to assign values to elements without wondering if they're "right" or "wrong". I try many different combinations. I keep the values that seem to work, and I delete and replace values that don't. Instead of worrying
      about semantics or sloppy code, I'm focused on experimenting and learning the results of different combinations of values.</p>

    <h2>reflecting</h2>
    <p>I know I'm always in a better space to be productive when I'm not stressed about time. Today, especially, I was able to stay in a creative space, which I enjoy, rather than feeling pressured to perform under a time-constraint. Since I wasn't concerned
      with how my code looked, I was more oriented toward the product. This, in turn, maximized my time: I took less time assessing and re-assessing code in my mind, and spent the time I had actively learning how many different values affect my HTML.
      After having played around with all kinds of float values in CSS, I was able to incorporate them effectively into my stylesheets, along with flex-box. Obviously having more tools at my command will enable me to accomplish more detailed and precise
      styling and design in the future. In addition to learning more about float values, I also learned that being less critical of my process yields more results.</p>
