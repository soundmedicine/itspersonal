    <h2>setting the stage</h2>
    <p>This morning, my goal is to better orient myself with JavaScript. I've read some material about its features, and I've coded some relatively simple programs, but I'd like to gain a better understanding of functions and loops in particular. Today,
      I'd like to be able to get some practice. Set my stage, as usual, waking up early for a good workout, having a satisfying and nutritious breakfast, and getting some e-mails and texts out of the way. I reflect on what my objective is. Because my
      confidence level using JavaScript is very low, I'll be thrilled if I'm able to look at the g-money submission requirements and have an idea of how to approach the required solutions. My plan is this: read up on the JavaScript exercises in the repository,
      read through the submission requirements, attend the breakout on loops, read through the submission again, attend the breakout on functions, read the submission again, and hope that each time I read the submission drill requirements, I will have
      a better understanding of how to approach and fulfill them. Find well-lit, comfortable spot by some windows. Close up some tabs on my computer that don't concern my work now. Open up the repository. Cue up playlist. Execute.</p>

    <h2>reflecting</h2>
    <p>I'm exhausted. The good news is that I was able to be very productive over long periods of time. I've grown accustomed to more frequent breaks. Reading up on JavaScript familiarized me with the terminology, and the breakouts helped immensely putting
      them into perspective. I found that each time I went back to the submission requirements, I had a better idea of how to go about the first drill. Tomorrow, I'll be able to spend more time creating some functions. I'd like to try coding some of my
      own simple functions and for loops, then take another look at the drills in the repository with some solid practice under my belt.</p>
