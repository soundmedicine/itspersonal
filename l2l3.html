    <h2>setting the stage</h2>
    <p>Today, my goal is to apply the JavaScript I'm comfortable with to my code for the Galvanize-money submissions. I'm familiar with most of the syntax of functions and loops, and can understand most of code that I see. My challenge thus far has been
      recalling it into my own code and making functions and loops work for me. The past few days, I've been absorbing as much as I can in breakouts and from online material I've searched. My code is still incomplete, I've been trying different things
      with suggestions I've found online, and today I will seek out more solutions to apply in the interest of making a submission soon. And I'll allow myself to play with different commands that I come across in my online research. I set my stage as
      usual by giving myself plenty of time in the morning, reflecting on my goals for the morning and the day, and committing myself to a comfortable environment that will facilitate my focus for the next couple hours. I've addressed any pressing matters
      in my texts and e-mails, and I've limited the open tabs on my computer to pages I'm referring to for my JavaScript submission. Also, I've made arrangements to work alongside a group of colleagues who are working on the same material, regardless
      of where they are in the process. This will also facilitate my focus, as our conversation will be centered around JavaScript code.</p>

    <h2>reflecting</h2>
    <p>What worked for me today was being able research some JavaScript terms and participate in conversations with my colleagues about these terms and their application. I'm definitely not as familiar with them as I'd like to or need to be, but it gave
      me some new commands to try in my code, which was productive. I realized I enjoy myself much more when I'm better prepared. In this case, having a larger vocabulary of code in JavaScript allowed me to worry less about submission requirements and
      focus more on learning. So for now, I think my best approach will be to continue reading up and playing around with code in REPLit, then allow myself time to play around with code in my submissions more.</p>
