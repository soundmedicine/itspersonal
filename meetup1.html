    <h1>Colorado Diversity in Tech, December 7, 2017</h1>
    <p>999 18th St. Denver Place building</p>

    <h2>people I met</h2>
    <p>CO-div founders Elaine and Dan</p>
    <p>GoSpotCheck recruiter, Brian</p>
    <p>GoSpotCheck retention specialist, Erin</p>

    <h2>what I learned</h2>
    <p>I learned that advocating for diversity, inclusivity, and cultural paradigm shift will be a large part of my legacy and brand. I learned there are many more advocates for diversity from many different backgrounds than I realize. I learned that the
      conversation hasn't collectively been started yet, and I'm excited to be an advocate and to represent my demographic(s).</p>

    <h2>questions I have</h2>
    <p>Where else can we start this conversation? How can I personally start this conversation? Who are my own advocates? Who can I be an advocate for?</p>
