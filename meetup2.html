    <h1>Code for Denver, December 18, 2017</h1>
    <p>Galvanize, Golden Triangle</p>

    <h2>people I met</h2>
    <p>web development teacher at Hinkley High School, Michelle</p>
    <p>web development student at Turing, Katie</p>

    <h2>what I learned</h2>
    <p>I learned that Code for Denver is part of a larger organization known as the Code for America Brigaide; they nave an agenda of projects they work on each meeting; they hold more meetups a year than most chapters.</p>

    <h2>questions I have</h2>
    <p>I'd like to know if they are in contact with Colorado Diversity in Tech, and if they are looking for new leadership. The leaders at this meeting seemed very inexperienced and awkward, however they've managed to draw quite a diverse group of volunteers.
      Also, they do a lot of work for Denver, of course, but I'd like to know if this chapter also aids other organizations around Colorado outside of Denver.</p>
