    <h1>Learn to Code Colorado, 2017 December 20</h1>
    <p>Galvanize Platte</p>

    <h2>people I met</h2>
    <p>Talked to Melissa, who recently was laid off from an administrative job. She's considering joining the tech industry. Also, Kyle, who currently works for Graphik, is considering joinging the six-month web development immersive and was asking me about
      my experience in the program thus far.</p>

    <h2>what I learned</h2>
    <p>I learned to work with grid values in CSS, and experimented mixing units (pixels, em, percentage, fractionals). I also got a chance to study code for other websites, paying particular attention to animation properties, such as transform and transition.</p>

    <h2>questions I have</h2>
    <p>After talking with some of the other attendees with no background in coding or the tech industry, I started wondering about other approaches to preparing to enter the field: Is it productive to learn the terminology and semantics before actually writing
      code, or is it more efficient to learn both simultaneously? Could a young child effectively work as a web developer after enough experience? After doing some research and experimenting with animation in CSS, could it ever be as effective or as finely
      tuned if I don't also incorporate some JavaScript?</p>
